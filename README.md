# Fluxi

**Fluxi** is your smart assistant for designing and improving business processes — made for small businesses, teams, and consultants who want clarity without complexity.

## Why Fluxi?

Most process tools are built for large corporations, complex systems, or technical users.

**Fluxi is different.**  
It helps anyone – even without a tech background – to **visually map** their workflows and get **instant feedback** from an AI that thinks like a process expert.

You don’t need to install anything.  
You don’t need to know BPMN.  
You just describe or draw your process, and Fluxi helps you **spot inefficiencies, missing steps, and ways to improve**.
